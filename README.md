# Convolutional autoencoder (CAE) Segmentation masks
This project addresses a variant of a convolutional autoencoder model that aims to predict segmentation masks, i.e., 
learning the characteristics of an object in an image and creating pixel-level predictions that accurately outline the shape  of the object. 
The training data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapakah68/segmentation-full-body-tiktok-dancing dataset. 

From this dataset, one of the records containing 10 images and 10 annotations corresponding to the images was taken. 
The purpose of the model is to learn from 3 images the element to be segmented and make predictions on the rest of the images.
